# KOA-Recipes

## What:
Our website is a platform for sharing a recipe. Users can share recipes and try recipes shared by other users. And once they do, they can either tick tried and works or doesn't work. 

## How:
### Day 1:
We discussed the concept of the project, the task disribution, the database schema and relations. We reassigned tasks several times until we settled on a satisfactory distribution. Where ,as we have three pages: the sign-in, sign-up and homepage, each person would get to do a page and thus be exposed to the multiple layers and combonants of a website.

### Day 2:
THe bulk of the project was on day 2. We attempted creating a whole, functioning website in a day. It was super stressful and we didn't tick all the boxes. However, it was satisfactory concerning the learning process. People who only did parts they were
comfortable with experinced new layers of the project they weren't acquanited with.

### User journey :
* As a user interested in cooking:
> "I would like a platform through which I can share and and read recipes shared by other users"
* As a user who liked trying guranteed recipes:
> "An indicator of wether a recipe is tried or untried and how many gave each would be ideal"
